# Installs dnsmasq and adds it as a nameserver.
#
# --start - Starts the service.  If not specified, the service will not be
#           running when the formula finishes.
#
# When `--start` is used, `/etc/resolv.conf` is updated to use dnsmasq.
# Without `--start`, the nameserver entry is not added.  It would be assumed
# that either the machine will be rebooted (and thus dnsmasq's nameserver
# entry would be added with the dhclient hook) or `/etc/resolv.conf` will
# be updated at a later time when dnsmasq is enabled.
#
# Examples
#
#   wickFormula dnsmasq
#
#   wickFormula dnsmasq --start
#
# Returns nothing
wickGetOption start start "$@"
wickPackage dnsmasq
wickMakeDir /etc/dnsmasq.d/
wickSetConfigLine /etc/dnsmasq.conf "conf-dir=/etc/dnsmasq.d"
