Python-virtualenv
=================

Installs the Python virtual environment manager, virtualenv.

Virtual Environments are a common way of managing per-project dependancies in the Python world. This formula installs the python-virtualenv package.

Currently Centos and Ubuntu use the same package name so this formula is very simple However if at any point they diverge, or another distro/OS is supported by wick, having this formula will mean chaning only a single place.

Examples
